Axios Integration Guide
Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use Axios, a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. Axios provides a simple and easy-to-use API to send requests to servers, handle responses, and manage errors. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of Axios in your project, along with example code and best practices.

Installation
To use Axios in your project, you can install it via npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
# Using npm
npm install axios

# Using yarn
yarn add axios
Alternatively, you can include it via a CDN in your HTML file:

html
Copy code
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of making a GET request using Axios:

javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');

// Make a GET request
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('There was an error!', error);
    });
You can also make POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of HTTP requests:

javascript
Copy code
axios.post('https://api.example.com/data', {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
})
.then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('There was an error!', error);
});
Handling Responses
Axios automatically handles JSON data, but you can also work with other formats. Here's an example of accessing the response data:

javascript
Copy code
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Status:', response.status);
        console.log('Headers:', response.headers);
        console.log('Data:', response.data);
    });
Error Handling
Error handling in Axios is straightforward. Here's how you can handle different types of errors:

javascript
Copy code
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        if (error.response) {
            // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
            console.error('Error Response:', error.response.status, error.response.data);
        } else if (error.request) {
            // The request was made but no response was received
            console.error('No Response:', error.request);
        } else {
            // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
            console.error('Error:', error.message);
        }
    });
Interceptors
Axios allows you to intercept requests or responses before they are handled by .then() or .catch():

javascript
Copy code
// Add a request interceptor
axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {
    // Do something before the request is sent
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    return config;
}, error => {
    // Do something with request error
    return Promise.reject(error);
});

// Add a response interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(response => {
    // Do something with response data
    return response;
}, error => {
    // Do something with response error
    return Promise.reject(error);
});
Advanced Features
Custom Instance: Create an Axios instance with custom configuration:
javascript
Copy code
const customAxios = axios.create({
    baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
    timeout: 1000,
    headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'}
});
Concurrent Requests: Handle multiple requests at the same time:
javascript
Copy code
axios.all([
    axios.get('/user'),
    axios.get('/comments')
]).then(axios.spread((user, comments) => {
    console.log('User:', user.data);
    console.log('Comments:', comments.data);
}));
